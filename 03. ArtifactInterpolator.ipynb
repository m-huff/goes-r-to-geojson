    "# Script #3 - Pixel Noise Remover (Neighborhood Pixel Interpolation)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Mike Huff, 2025*\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/m-huff\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find that you don't have any weird visual artifacts or bad pixels appearing in your GEOTIFF, you can skip this script and move on to *Script #4*!\n",
    "\n",
    "This script takes the possible threshold values from *Script #2* and allows you to visually determine where to set your pixel threshold to remove \"noise\" in the GEOTIFF image. The script identifies pixels above the input threshold value (stored in the THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE variable), then tries to iteratively fill them based on the median of the neighboring pixels. The script will try to do this several times, closing gaps made in the raster by excluding certain pixels above the threshold value. The maximum number of times the script will attempt this is stored in the MAX_INTERPOLATION_ITERATIONS variable. Changing this value may result in strange holes appearing in the output raster, so I recommend leaving that at 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this script iteratively and review the generated plots after running (they are in the console ouput below the code cell) to determine whether the threshold you're using is adequately taking care of any outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, change the \"geotiff_path\" and \"output_path\" variables to match the actual locations of files (and desired output locations) on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: In some cases, you may encounter an error with the \"scipy\" module that requires you to download the \"scipy wheels\". To do so, please follow the below set of instructions.\n",

    "# Installing SciPy from a Wheel File\n",
    "\n",
    "If `pip install scipy` fails or you need a specific version, you can manually download and install a precompiled **wheel (.whl)** file. Follow the steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Visit the Unofficial Python Wheels Repository\n",
    "Go to [**Christoph Gohlke’s Python Wheels**](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/).  \n",
    "This site hosts precompiled Python packages (especially useful for Windows users).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Check Your Python and System Version\n",
    "Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux) and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "python -m pip debug --verbose | find \"architecture\"\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "Example output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python 3.10.12\n",
    "architecture: 64bit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Take note of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Python version** → e.g., 3.10\n",
    "* **System architecture** → e.g., 64-bit\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Download the Correct `.whl` File\n",
    "\n",
    "On the wheels site, find **SciPy** and download the file that matches your version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example filename:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "scipy-1.11.3-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `cp310` = Python 3.10\n",
    "* `win_amd64` = 64-bit Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the file to your **Downloads** folder (or anywhere convenient).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Install the Wheel via pip\n",
    "\n",
    "In your command prompt, navigate to the folder containing the wheel:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd %USERPROFILE%\\Downloads\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then install SciPy with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install scipy-1.11.3-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For macOS or Linux, you can usually install directly from PyPI:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install scipy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Verify the Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Confirm that SciPy is installed correctly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m pip show scipy\n",
    "python -c \"import scipy; print(scipy.__version__)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the version prints successfully, you’re all set!\n",
    "\n"
